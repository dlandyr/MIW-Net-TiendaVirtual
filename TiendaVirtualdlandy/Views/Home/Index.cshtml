            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
             born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
             great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or 
             avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
             pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful."

            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
            the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
            through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain."
